## React Pokedex 

This is a simple Pokedex application built with React. It utilizes a public Pokemon API to fetch and display data about various Pokemon. By leveraging the power of React's component-based architecture.

To enhance the user experience, the Pokedex leverages the SWR library for efficient data fetching. SWR provides caching, revalidation, and error handling capabilities, resulting in a seamless and reliable data retrieval process. Additionally, the MUI (Material-UI) library is used for styling and design, offering a visually appealing and consistent look and feel across the application.

## Local Development
Follow these steps to run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

After running these commands, the application should be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if you've configured it differently).

## Technologies

### PokeAPI
The [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) is used to fetch data about various Pokemon. The API is public and free to use, and it provides a wealth of information about Pokemon species, abilities, moves, and more.

### Next.js
Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that simplifies the development of React applications. Next.js handles routing, server-side rendering, and other aspects of the application.

### SWR
This project uses the [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) library to handle data fetching. SWR is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching that provides features like caching, revalidation, and error handling.

### MUI (Material-UI)
This project uses [MUI (Material-UI)](https://mui.com/) for styling and design. MUI provides a set of pre-built components and styles that can be used to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

### TypeScript
This project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed superset of JavaScript that provides type checking and other features to help catch errors and improve code quality.
